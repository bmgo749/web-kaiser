# Admin Management System with WhatsApp Integration

## Overview

This is a comprehensive admin management system with advanced user interaction and monitoring capabilities. The system features WhatsApp messaging integration using the Baileys library, allowing administrators to send and receive messages, manage templates, and monitor chat activity in real-time. The application includes admin logging, user activity tracking, and a responsive mobile-friendly interface.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **3D Graphics**: React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber) with Three.js
- **3D Utilities**: @react-three/drei for enhanced 3D components and helpers
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling via Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for 3D assets

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **Production Build**: esbuild for server bundling

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client and server code in separate directories with shared schemas
- **3D-First Approach**: Built around Three.js for immersive solar system visualization
- **Component-Based UI**: Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled components styled with Tailwind
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend, backend, and shared code

## Key Components

### 3D Scene Components
- **SolarSystem**: Main container managing all celestial objects and time progression
- **Star**: Central star (S-Centagma) with glow effects and pulsing animation
- **Planet**: Individual planet components with orbital mechanics and interaction
- **AsteroidBelt**: Procedurally generated asteroid field between planets
- **Floor**: Ground reference plane (currently in development)

### UI Components
- **TimeControls**: Play/pause, time scale adjustment, and reset functionality
- **PlanetInfo**: Detailed information panel for selected planets
- **Interface**: Game state management and audio controls
- **IntroSequence**: Welcome screen with animated text sequence and blur effects

### State Management
- **useSolarSystem**: Manages time scale, pause state, elapsed time, and planet selection
- **useGame**: Handles game phases (ready, playing, ended)
- **useAudio**: Audio system for background music and sound effects
- **useIntro**: Controls intro sequence state and text transitions

## Data Flow

1. **Time Progression**: SolarSystem component updates elapsed time based on time scale
2. **Orbital Mechanics**: Each Planet calculates its position using elapsed time and orbital period
3. **User Interaction**: Planet clicks update selected planet state, triggering info panel display
4. **Time Controls**: UI controls modify time scale and pause state, affecting all orbital calculations
5. **Camera Controls**: OrbitControls provide user navigation around the 3D scene

## External Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- **@react-three/fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei**: Three.js utilities and helpers
- **@react-three/postprocessing**: Visual effects and post-processing
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management (prepared for future API integration)
- **zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **three**: 3D graphics library
- **express**: Web server framework
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe SQL ORM
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database adapter

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Uses Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- tsx for TypeScript execution of Express server
- Concurrent development on port 5000

### Production Build
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Deployment**: Replit autoscale deployment serving on port 80

### Database Strategy
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- Schema definitions in shared directory
- Migration system ready for database deployment
- In-memory storage fallback for development

### Asset Handling
- Support for 3D models (.gltf, .glb)
- Audio files (.mp3, .ogg, .wav)
- GLSL shader support via vite-plugin-glsl
- Font loading with @fontsource/inter
