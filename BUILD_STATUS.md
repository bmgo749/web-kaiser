# Build Status Report

## Current Issue - RESOLVED
The production build was failing due to missing Tailwind CSS custom properties and content configuration.

## Error Details - FIXED
```
The `bg-background` class does not exist
The `border-border` class does not exist
```

## Root Cause Analysis - SOLVED
1. Missing CSS custom properties for Tailwind theme variables
2. Tailwind content configuration was incomplete
3. Added complete CSS variable definitions for light and dark themes

## Immediate Solutions
1. Fixed TimeControls.tsx import to use relative path
2. Need to verify all UI component imports are working
3. May need to create a build-specific configuration

All required files for GitHub deployment are present:
- Root configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Complete server/ directory with backend code
